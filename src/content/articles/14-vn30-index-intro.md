# VN30 Index: Overview and Composition

## What Is the VN30?

The VN30 is a benchmark index of the 30 largest and most liquid stocks listed on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange (HOSE). It is widely used as a reference for the performance of Vietnam's large-cap equity segment and as the underlying for index derivatives (e.g. VN30 futures traded on HNX).

## Composition and Methodology

- Constituents are selected based on market capitalization and liquidity criteria defined by the exchange.
- The index is reviewed and rebalanced periodically; weightings are typically free-float adjusted.
- Sector representation reflects the structure of the Vietnamese large-cap market (e.g. banking, real estate, consumer, industrials).

## Use Cases

- **Benchmarking**: Fund managers and analysts use VN30 to measure large-cap market performance.
- **Derivatives**: VN30 futures and related products allow hedging and exposure to the Vietnamese equity market.
- **ETFs and products**: Some investment products track or reference the VN30.

## Relation to Other Indices

- **VN-Index**: Broad HOSE index; VN30 is a subset of the large-cap segment.
- **VN100**: Includes the next 70 names after VN30; broader large-cap coverage.
