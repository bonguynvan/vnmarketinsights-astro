    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Vietnam's logistics sector has experienced rapid development to support the country's
      manufacturing export economy and booming domestic e-commerce. With a long coastline,
      major ports, and an expanding highway network, Vietnam serves as both a production hub
      for global supply chains and a growing consumer market requiring last-mile delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The logistics market remains fragmented with a mix of state-owned enterprises,
      international freight forwarders, and local last-mile specialists competing across
      different segments of the value chain.
