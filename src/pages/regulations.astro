    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>

      business establishment, foreign investment, data protection, e-commerce, payments,
      and industry-specific requirements. Regulatory interpretation and enforcement can
      vary by region and sector.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foreign businesses must navigate ownership restrictions, licensing requirements,
      and local partnership obligations that vary significantly by industry.
